# BigQuery ML

BigQuery Machine Learning (BigQuery ML) enables users to create and execute machine learning models in BigQuery using SQL queries. The goal is to democratise machine learning by enabling SQL practitioners to build models using their existing tools and to increase development speed by eliminating the need for data movement.

# Model queries
Examples: 
```sql
-- create model
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `bqml_lab.sample_model`
OPTIONS(model_type='logistic_reg') AS
SELECT
  IF(totals.transactions IS NULL, 0, 1) AS label,
  IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os,
  device.isMobile AS is_mobile,
  IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country,
  IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
WHERE
  _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170631'
LIMIT 100000;

-- evaluate models
SELECT * FROM
  ml.EVALUATE(MODEL `bqml_lab.sample_model`, (
SELECT
  IF(totals.transactions IS NULL, 0, 1) AS label,
  IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os,
  device.isMobile AS is_mobile,
  IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country,
  IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
WHERE
  _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170801'));

-- model predictions
SELECT
  country,
  SUM(predicted_label) as total_predicted_purchases
FROM
  ml.PREDICT(MODEL `bqml_lab.sample_model`, (
SELECT
  IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os,
  device.isMobile AS is_mobile,
  IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews,
  IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
WHERE
  _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170801'))
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY total_predicted_purchases DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Example for classification model using logistic regression

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `ecommerce.classification_model`
OPTIONS
(
model_type='logistic_reg',
labels = ['will_buy_on_return_visit']
)
AS
#standardSQL
SELECT
  * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
FROM
  # features
  (SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
    IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
  FROM
    `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  WHERE
    totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170430') # train on first 9 months
  JOIN
  (SELECT
    fullvisitorid,
    IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM
      `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
  USING (fullVisitorId);

-- calculate area under receiver operating characteristic curve
SELECT
  roc_auc,
  CASE
    WHEN roc_auc > .9 THEN 'good'
    WHEN roc_auc > .8 THEN 'fair'
    WHEN roc_auc > .7 THEN 'decent'
    WHEN roc_auc > .6 THEN 'not great'
  ELSE 'poor' END AS model_quality
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL ecommerce.classification_model,  (
SELECT
  * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
FROM
  # features
  (SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
    IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
  FROM
    `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  WHERE
    totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20170501' AND '20170630') # eval on 2 months
  JOIN
  (SELECT
    fullvisitorid,
    IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM
      `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
  USING (fullVisitorId)
));
